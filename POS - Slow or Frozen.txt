# ISSUE: Slow or Frozen POS

Before advancing to next step, please take a screenshot of the following:
- Connection status, so we can see how many days it has been running consecutively
- Task manager sorted by memory
- Task manager sorted by CPU

Then, please reboot the machine. 

If the reboot fixes the issue, please send an email our support address with the business name/location in the subject. If it was a particular POS, please mention that too (e.g. POS2). Please attach the screenshots to the email.
