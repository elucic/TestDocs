# ISSUE: Kitchen Printer always needs to be Rebooted

If you get an issue about a Kitchen Printer that works but suddenly stops and needs to be rebooted for it to start working again and this happens multiple times a day, it could be an electric problem.
Ask the client to connect power cable to a Battery Backup.
