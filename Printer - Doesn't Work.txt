# ISSUE: My printer doesn't work.

## STEP 1
Ask if user has a MEV
If user doesn't have a MEV, go directly to STEP 2.
If the user has a MEV, make sure the green light is on the MEV. If it's not on, turn on the MEV. It should print a small receipt stating MEV prÃªt.
Then go to STEP 2.

## STEP 2
Make sure printer is online by verifying that it has a green light on.

## STEP 3
If the printer is on, you can try to print a test page:
 - Power the printer off.
 - Press the FEED button while simultaneously turning on the printer.
 - The printer should print out the firmware version and communication settings.
 - Press the FEED button again - the printer should print a sequence of letters, numbers, and symbols.
 - Press the power button to turn off the printer.
 - Press the power button to turn the printer back on, if desired.
