# ISSUE: Slow or Frozen POS

## STEP 1:
First of all, take a screenshot of the following:
- Connection status, so we can see how many days it has been running consecutively
- Task manager sorted by memory
- Task manager sorted by CPU

## STEP 2
Reboot the machine

## STEP 3
If the reboot fixes the issue, send an Email to Mike with the Business name/ Location in the Subject.
If it was a particular POS, mention that too Ex: POS2.
And attach the screenshots.
